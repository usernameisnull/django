==================================
Organization of the Django Project
==================================

Principles
==========

The Django Project is managed by a team of volunteers pursuing three goals:

- Driving the development of the Django web framework,
- Fostering the ecosystem of Django-related software,
- Leading the Django community in accordance with the values described in the
  `Django Code of Conduct`_.

The Django Project isn't a legal entity. The `Django Software Foundation`_, a
non-profit organization, handles financial and legal matters related to the
Django Project. Other than that, the Django Software Foundation lets the
Django Project manage the development of the Django framework, its ecosystem
and its community.

Technical board
===============

Role
----

The technical board is a group of experienced and active committers who steer
technical choices. Their main concern is to maintain the quality and stability
of the Django web framework.

Prerogatives
------------

The technical board holds two prerogatives:

- Making major technical decisions when no consensus is found otherwise. This
  happens on the |django-developers| mailing-list.
- Veto a grant of commit access or remove commit access. This happens on the
  ``django-core`` mailing-list.

In both cases, the technical board is a last resort. In these matters, it
fulfills a similar function to the former Benevolent Dictators For Life.

When the board wants to exercise one of these prerogatives, it must hold a
private, simple majority vote on the resolution. The quorum is the full
committee â€” each member must cast a vote or abstain explicitly. Then the board
communicates the result, and if possible the reasons, on the appropriate
mailing-list. There's no appeal for such decisions.

In addition, at its discretion, the technical board may act in an advisory
capacity on non-technical decisions.

Membership
----------

`The technical board`_ is an elected group of five committers. They're expected
to be experienced but there's no formal seniority requirement.

A new board is elected after each feature release of Django. The election
process is managed by a returns officer nominated by the outgoing technical
board. The election process works as follows:

#. Candidates advertise their application for the technical board to the team.

   They must be committers already. There's no term limit for technical board
   members.

#. Each team member can vote for zero to five people among the candidates.
   Candidates are ranked by the total number of votes they received.

   In case of a tie, the person who joined the core team earlier wins.

Both the application and the voting period last between one and two weeks, at
the outgoing board's discretion.

Changing the organization

Changes to this document require a four fifths majority of votes cast in a
core team vote and no veto by the technical board.
