==================================
Organization of the Django Project
==================================

Principles
==========

The Django Project is managed by a team of volunteers pursuing three goals:

- Driving the development of the Django web framework,
- Fostering the ecosystem of Django-related software,
- Leading the Django community in accordance with the values described in the
  `Django Code of Conduct`_.

The Django Project isn't a legal entity. The `Django Software Foundation`_, a
non-profit organization, handles financial and legal matters related to the
Django Project. Other than that, the Django Software Foundation lets the
Django Project manage the development of the Django framework, its ecosystem
and its community.

Mergers
=======

Role
----

Mergers_ are a small set of people who merge pull requests to the `Django Git
repository <https://github.com/django/django>`_.

Prerogatives
------------

Mergers hold the following prerogatives:

- Merging any pull request which constitutes a `minor change`_ (small enough
  not to require the use of the `DEP process`_). A Merger must not merge a
  change primarily authored by that Merger, unless the pull request has been
  approved by:

  - another Merger,
  - a technical board member,
  - a member of the `triage & review team`_, or
  - a member of the `security team`_.

- Initiating discussion of a minor change in the appropriate venue, and request
  that other Mergers refrain from merging it while discussion proceeds.
- Requesting a vote of the technical board regarding any minor change if, in
  the Merger's opinion, discussion has failed to reach a consensus.
- Requesting a vote of the technical board when a `major change`_ (significant
  enough to require the use of the `DEP process`_) reaches one of its
  implementation milestones and is intended to merge.

.. _`major change`: https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0010-new-governance.rst#terminology

Membership
----------

`The technical board`_ selects Mergers_ as necessary to maintain their number
at a minimum of three, in order to spread the workload and avoid over-burdening
or burning out any individual Merger. There is no upper limit to the number of
Mergers.

It's not a requirement that a Merger is also a Django Fellow, but the Django
Software Foundation has the power to use funding of Fellow positions as a way
to make the role of Merger sustainable.

The following restrictions apply to the role of Merger:

- A person must not simultaneously serve as a member of the technical board. If
  a Merger is elected to the technical board, they shall cease to be a Merger
  immediately upon taking up membership in the technical board.
- A person may serve in the roles of Releaser and Merger simultaneously.

The selection process, when a vacancy occurs or when the technical board deems
it necessary to select additional persons for such a role, occur as follows:

- Any member in good standing of an appropriate discussion venue, or the Django
  Software Foundation board acting with the input of the DSF's Fellowship
  committee, may suggest a person for consideration.
- The technical board considers the suggestions put forth, and then any member
  of the technical board formally nominates a candidate for the role.
- The technical board votes on nominees.

Mergers may resign their role at any time, but should endeavor to provide some
advance notice in order to allow the selection of a replacement. Termination of
the contract of a Django Fellow by the Django Software Foundation temporarily
suspends that person's Merger role until such time as the technical board can
vote on their nomination.

Otherwise, a Merger may be removed by:

- Becoming disqualified due to election to the technical board.
- Becoming disqualified due to actions taken by the Code of Conduct committee
  of the Django Software Foundation.
- A vote of the technical board.

Releasers
=========

Role
----

Releasers_ are a small set of people who have the authority to upload packaged
releases of Django to the `Python Package Index`_, and to the
`djangoproject.com`_ website.

Prerogatives
------------

Releasers_ :doc:`build Django releases </internals/howto-release-django>` and
upload them to the `Python Package Index`_, and to the `djangoproject.com`_
website.

Technical board
===============

Role
----

The technical board is a group of experienced and active committers who steer
technical choices. Their main concern is to maintain the quality and stability
of the Django web framework.

Prerogatives
------------

The technical board holds two prerogatives:

- Making major technical decisions when no consensus is found otherwise. This
  happens on the |django-developers| mailing-list.
- Veto a grant of commit access or remove commit access. This happens on the
  ``django-core`` mailing-list.

In both cases, the technical board is a last resort. In these matters, it
fulfills a similar function to the former Benevolent Dictators For Life.

When the board wants to exercise one of these prerogatives, it must hold a
private, simple majority vote on the resolution. The quorum is the full
committee â€” each member must cast a vote or abstain explicitly. Then the board
communicates the result, and if possible the reasons, on the appropriate
mailing-list. There's no appeal for such decisions.

In addition, at its discretion, the technical board may act in an advisory
capacity on non-technical decisions.

Membership
----------

`The technical board`_ is an elected group of five committers. They're expected
to be experienced but there's no formal seniority requirement.

A new board is elected after each feature release of Django. The election
process is managed by a returns officer nominated by the outgoing technical
board. The election process works as follows:

#. Candidates advertise their application for the technical board to the team.

   They must be committers already. There's no term limit for technical board
   members.

#. Each team member can vote for zero to five people among the candidates.
   Candidates are ranked by the total number of votes they received.

   In case of a tie, the person who joined the core team earlier wins.

Both the application and the voting period last between one and two weeks, at
the outgoing board's discretion.

Changing the organization
=========================

Changes to this document require a four fifths majority of votes cast in a
core team vote and no veto by the technical board.
