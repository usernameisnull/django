Django 1.8.1 fixes several bugs in 1.8.

Bugfixes
========

* Added support for serializing :class:`~datetime.timedelta` objects in
  migrations (:ticket:`24566`).

* Restored proper parsing of the :djadmin:`testserver` command's positional
  arguments (fixture names) (:ticket:`24571`).

* Prevented ``TypeError`` in translation functions ``check_for_language()`` and
  ``get_language_bidi()`` when translations are deactivated (:ticket:`24569`).

* Fixed :djadmin:`squashmigrations` command when using
  :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.SeparateDatabaseAndState`
  (:ticket:`24278`).

* Stripped microseconds from ``datetime`` values when using an older version of
  the MySQLdb DB API driver as it does not support fractional seconds
  (:ticket:`24584`).

* Fixed a migration crash when altering
  :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`\s (:ticket:`24513`).

* Fixed a crash with ``QuerySet.update()`` on foreign keys to one-to-one fields
  (:ticket:`24578`).

* Fixed a regression in the model detail view of
  :mod:`~django.contrib.admindocs` when a model has a reverse foreign key
  relation (:ticket:`24624`).

* Prevented arbitrary file inclusions in :mod:`~django.contrib.admindocs`
  (:ticket:`24625`).

* Fixed a crash with ``QuerySet.update()`` on foreign keys to instances with
  ``uuid`` primary keys (:ticket:`24611`).

* Fixed database introspection with SQLite 3.8.9 (released April 8, 2015)
  (:ticket:`24637`).

* Updated ``urlpatterns`` examples generated by :djadmin:`startproject` to
  remove usage of referencing views by dotted path in
  :func:`~django.conf.urls.url` which is deprecated in Django 1.8
  (:ticket:`24635`).

* Fixed queries where an expression was referenced in ``order_by()``, but wasn't
  part of the select clause. An example query is
  ``qs.annotate(foo=F('field')).values('pk').order_by('foo'))`` (:ticket:`24615`).

* Fixed a database table name quoting regression (:ticket:`24605`).

* Prevented the loss of ``null``/``not null`` column properties during field
  alteration of MySQL databases (:ticket:`24595`).
