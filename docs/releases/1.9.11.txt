Django 1.9.11 release notes
===========================

*November 1, 2016*

Django 1.9.11 fixes two security issues in 1.9.10.

User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle
=================================================================

When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database
user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database
settings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow
an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.

This user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using
the ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session
(such as an attacker's connection).

A randomly generated password is now used for each test run.
