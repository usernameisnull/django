Django 4.2.6 release notes
==========================

*October 4, 2023*

Django 4.2.6 fixes a security issue with severity "moderate" and several bugs
in 4.2.5.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2.5 where overriding the deprecated
  ``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE`` and ``STATICFILES_STORAGE`` settings in tests caused
  the main ``STORAGES`` to mutate (:ticket:`34821`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.2 that caused unnecessary casting of string
  based fields (``CharField``, ``EmailField``, ``TextField``, ``CICharField``,
  ``CIEmailField``, and ``CITextField``) used with the ``__isnull`` lookup on
  PostgreSQL. As a consequence, the pre-Django 4.2 indexes didn't match and
  were not used by the query planner (:ticket:`34840`).

  You may need to recreate indexes propagated to the database with Django
  4.2 - 4.2.5 as they contain unnecessary ``::text`` casting that is avoided as
  of this release.
