Django 1.7.3 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.7.3 fixes several bugs in 1.7.2.



Bugfixes
========

* The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher has been
  increased by 25%. This part of the normal major release process was
  inadvertently omitted in 1.7. This backwards compatible change will not
  affect users who have subclassed
  ``django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher`` to change the
  default value.

* Fixed a crash in the CSRF middleware when handling non-ASCII referer header
  (:ticket:`23815`).

* Fixed a crash in the ``django.contrib.auth.redirect_to_login`` view when
  passing a :func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse_lazy` result on Python 3
  (:ticket:`24097`).

* Added correct formats for Greek (``el``) (:ticket:`23967`).

* Fixed a migration crash when unapplying a migration where multiple operations
  interact with the same model (:ticket:`24110`).
