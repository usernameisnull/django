Django 3.2.1 fixes several bugs in 3.2.

Bugfixes
========

* Corrected detection of GDAL 3.2 on Windows (:ticket:`32544`).

  ``SmallAutoField`` were not allowed for the :setting:`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`
  setting (:ticket:`32620`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused a crash of
  ``QuerySet.values()/values_list()`` after ``QuerySet.union()``,
  ``intersection()``, and ``difference()`` when it was ordered by an
  unannotated field (:ticket:`32627`).

* Restored, following a regression in Django 3.2, displaying an exception
