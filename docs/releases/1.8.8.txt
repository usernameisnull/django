Django 1.8.8 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.8.8 fixes several bugs in 1.8.7.

Python 3.2 users, please be advised that we've decided to drop support for
Python 3.2 in Django 1.8.x at the end of 2016. We won't break things
intentionally after that, but we won't test subsequent releases against Python
3.2 either. Upstream support for Python 3.2 ends February 2016 so we don't find
much value in providing security updates for a version of Python that could be
insecure. To read more about the decision and to let us know if this will be
problematic for you, please read the `django-developers thread
<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/eMu5UQpUdWs/discussion>`_.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed incorrect ``unique_together`` field name generation by ``inspectdb``
  (:ticket:`25274`).

* Corrected ``__len`` query lookup on ``ArrayField`` for empty arrays
  (:ticket:`25772`).

* Restored the ability to use custom formats from ``formats.py`` with
  ``django.utils.formats.get_format()`` and the ``date`` template filter
  (:ticket:`25812`).

* Fixed a state bug when migrating a ``SeparateDatabaseAndState`` operation
  backwards (:ticket:`25896`).
