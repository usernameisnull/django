Django 2.2.26 release notes
===========================

*January 4, 2022*

Django 2.2.26 fixes one security issue with severity "medium" and two security
issues with severity "low" in 2.2.25.

CVE-2021-45115: Denial-of-service possibility in ``UserAttributeSimilarityValidator``
=====================================================================================

:class:`.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator` incurred significant overhead
evaluating submitted password that were artificially large in relative to the
comparison values. On the assumption that access to user registration was
unrestricted this provided a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack.

In order to mitigate this issue, relatively long values are now ignored by
``UserAttributeSimilarityValidator``.

This issue has severity "medium" according to the :ref:`Django security policy
<security-disclosure>`.
