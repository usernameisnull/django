Django 2.0.5 release notes
==========================

*Expected May 1, 2018*

Django 2.0.5 fixes several bugs in 2.0.4.

Bugfixes
========

* Corrected the import paths that ``inspectdb`` generates for
  ``django.contrib.postgres`` fields (:ticket:`29307`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 1.11.8 where altering a field with a unique
  constraint may drop and rebuild more foreign keys than necessary
  (:ticket:`29193`).
