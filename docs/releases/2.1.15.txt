Django 2.1.15 release notes
===========================

*Expected December 2, 2019*

Django 2.1.15 fixes a data loss bug in 2.1.14.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a data loss possibility in the
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update()`. When using
  ``'self'`` in the ``of`` argument with :ref:`multi-table inheritance
  <multi-table-inheritance>`, a parent model was locked instead of the
  queryset's model (:ticket:`30953`).
