Django 1.5.9 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.5.9 fixes several security issues in 1.5.8.

:func:`~django.core.urlresolvers.reverse()` could generate URLs pointing to other hosts
=======================================================================================

In certain situations, URL reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs  (URLs
starting with two slashes), which could unexpectedly redirect a user  to a
different host. An attacker could exploit this, for example, by redirecting
users to a phishing site designed to ask for user's passwords.

To remedy this, URL reversing now ensures that no URL starts with two slashes
(//), replacing the second slash with its URL encoded counterpart (%2F). This
approach ensures that semantics stay the same, while making the URL relative to
the domain and not to the scheme.
