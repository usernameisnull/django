Django 2.2.11 release notes
===========================

*Expected March 2, 2020*

Django 2.2.11 fixes a data loss bug in 2.2.10.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a data loss possibility in the
  :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_for_update`. When using
  related fields or parent link fields with :ref:`multi-table-inheritance` in
  the ``of`` argument, the corresponding models were not locked
  (:ticket:`31246`).
