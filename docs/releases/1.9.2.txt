Django 1.9.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.9.2 fixes several bugs in 1.9.1.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in ``ConditionalGetMiddleware`` causing ``If-None-Match``
  checks to always return HTTP 200 (:ticket:`26024`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the "user-tools" items to display on the
  admin's logout page (:ticket:`26035`).

* Fixed a crash in the translations system when the current language has no
  translations (:ticket:`26046`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the incorrect day to be selected when opening
  the admin calendar widget for timezones from GMT+0100 to GMT+1200
  (:ticket:`24980`).

* Fixed a regression in the admin's edit related model popup that caused an
  escaped value to be displayed in the select dropdown of the parent window
  (:ticket:`25997`).

* Fixed incorrect index handling in migrations on PostgreSQL when adding
  ``db_index=True`` or ``unique=True`` to a ``CharField`` or ``TextField`` that
  already had the other specified, or when removing one of them from a field
  that had both (:ticket:`26034`).

* Fixed a regression where defining a relation on an abstract model's field
  using a string model name without an app_label no longer resolved that
  reference to the abstract model's app if using that model in another
  application (:ticket`25858`).
