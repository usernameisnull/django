Django 1.8.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.8.2 fixes several bugs in 1.8.1.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed check for template engine alias uniqueness (:ticket:`24685`).

* Fixed crash when reusing the same ``Case`` instance in a query
  (:ticket:`24752`).

* Corrected join promotion for ``Case`` expressions. For example, annotating a
  query with a  ``Case`` expression could unexpectedly filter out results
  (:ticket:`24766`).

* Fixed negated ``Q`` objects in expressions. Cases like
  ``Case(When(~Q(friends__age__lte=30)))`` tried to generate a subquery which
  resulted in a crash (:ticket:`24705`).

* Fixed incorrect GROUP BY clause generation on MySQL when the query's model
  has a self-referential foreign key (:ticket:`24748`).

* Implemented ``ForeignKey.get_db_prep_value()`` so that ``ForeignKey``\s
  pointing to :class:`~django.db.models.UUIDField` and inheritance on models
  with ``UUIDField`` primary keys work correctly (:ticket:`24698`,
  :ticket:`24712`).

* Fixed ``isnull`` lookup for ``HStoreField`` (:ticket:`24751`).

* Fixed a MySQL crash when a migration removes a combined index (unique_together
  or index_together) containing a foreign key (:ticket:`24757`).

* Fixed session cookie deletion when using :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`
  (:ticket:`24799`).

* On PostgreSQL, when no access is granted for the ``postgres`` database,
  Django now falls back to the default database when it normally requires a
  "no database" connection (:ticket:`24791`).

* Fixed display of ``contrib.admin``â€™s ``ForeignKey`` widget when it's used
  in a row with other fields (:ticket:`24784`).
