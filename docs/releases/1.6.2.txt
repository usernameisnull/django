Django 1.6.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

This is Django 1.6.2, a bugfix release for Django 1.6.

Bug fixes
=========

* Prevented the base geometry object of a prepared geometry to be garbage
  collected, which could lead to crash Django (#21662).

* Fixed a crash when executing the :djadmin:`changepassword` command when the
  user object representation contained non-ASCII characters (#21627).

* The :djadmin:`collectstatic` command will raise an error rather than
  default to using the current working directory if :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` is
  not set. Combined with the ``--clear`` option, the previous behavior could
  wipe anything below the current working directory.
