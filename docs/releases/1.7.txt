Django 1.7 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

Welcome to Django 1.7!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well as some `backwards
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django
1.6 or older versions. We've also dropped some features, which are detailed in
:doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`, and we've `begun the
deprecation process for some features`_.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in Django 1.7`_
.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.7`_

What's new in Django 1.7
========================

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the
    :doc:`deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>` for any features that
    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the
    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a
    backwards incompatible change.

Features deprecated in 1.7
==========================

``django.utils.unittest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.unittest`` provided uniform access to the ``unittest2`` library
on all Python versions. Since ``unittest2`` became the standard library's
:mod:`unittest` module in Python 2.7, and Django 1.7 drops support for older
Python versions, this module isn't useful anymore. It has been deprecated. Use
:mod:`unittest` instead.
