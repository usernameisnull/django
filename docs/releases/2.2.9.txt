Django 2.2.9 release notes
==========================

*Expected January 2, 2020*

Django 2.2.9 fixes a data loss bug in 2.2.8.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a data loss possibility in
  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField`. When using with
  ``ArrayField(BooleanField())``, all values after the first ``True`` value
  were marked as checked instead of preserving passed values (:ticket:`31073`).
