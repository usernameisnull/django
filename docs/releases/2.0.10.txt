===========================
Django 2.0.10 release notes
===========================

*Release date TBD*

Django 2.0.10 fixes several bugs in 2.0.9.

Bugfixes
========

* Prevented repetitive calls to ``geos_version_tuple()`` in the ``WKBWriter``
  class in an attempt to fix a random crash involving ``LooseVersion`` since
  Django 2.0.6 (:ticket:`29959`).

* Fixed a schema corruption issue on SQLite 3.26+. You might have to drop and
  rebuild your SQLite database if you applied a migration while using an older
  version of Django with SQLite 3.26 or later (:ticket:`29182`).

* Prevented SQLite schema alterations while foreign key checks are enabled to
  avoid the possibility of schema corruption (:ticket:`30023`).
