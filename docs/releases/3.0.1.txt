Django 3.0.1 release notes
==========================

*Expected January 2, 2020*

Django 3.0.1 fixes several bugs in 3.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 by restoring the ability to use Django
  inside Jupyter and other environments that force an async context, by adding
  an option to disable :ref:`async-safety` mechanism with
  ``DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE`` environment variable (:ticket:`31056`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.0 where ``RegexPattern``, used by
  :func:`~django.urls.re_path`, returned positional arguments to be passed to
  the view when all optional named groups were missing (:ticket:`31061`).

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 3.0,
  :class:`~django.db.models.expressions.Window` expressions to be used in
  conditions outside of queryset filters, e.g. in
  :class:`~django.db.models.expressions.When` conditions (:ticket:`31060`).

* Fixed a data loss possibility in
  :class:`~django.contrib.postgres.forms.SplitArrayField`. When using with
  ``ArrayField(BooleanField())``, all values after the first ``True`` value
  were marked as checked instead of preserving passed values (:ticket:`31073`).
